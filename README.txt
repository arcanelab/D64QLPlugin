Introduction
------------

The D64QLPlugin shows you the contents of a D64/D71/D81 disk image file. The
Icon View shows a reduced view of the directory in classic C64 style and skips
entries if there are too many entries. The detail view (Press Space in Finder)
shows the complete directory.

Installation
------------

Copy the Plugin D64QLPlugin.qlgenerator to ~/Library/QuickLook.
Copy the Font to ~/Library/Fonts.
Create the directory first if one is missing.

Done!

Special Thanks
--------------

The Plugin uses the diskimage.c Library written by Per Olofsson available
